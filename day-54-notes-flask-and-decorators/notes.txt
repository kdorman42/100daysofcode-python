Flask Quickstart
- Refresher: Day 35 environment vars
- Ensure Command Prompt is the terminal type, not Local (unless virtual env)
- Ctrl+C quits the app

Command Line
- pwd = print working directory (shows path)
- ls = list all files and folders in current directory
- cd = change directory ("cd .." takes you to parent folder)
- mkdir = make a new directory
- touch filename.ext = make a new file called filename with the extension .ext
- rm filename.ext = delete the file named filename.ext
- rm -rf FolderName = delete a folder "r" recursively and "f" forcibly

- function has a wrapper function inside that does something and calls the existing function
- @decorator_name is an example of "sugar syntax"...?

Flask debugger mode:
